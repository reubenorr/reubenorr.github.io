Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
<p>Usually they can reach heights up to 390â€³ Order pickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. You can also use an electric forklift outdoors.
