Ahern specializes in high reach equipment, which permits the safe lifting of people or materials to work at height.</p>

The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>
