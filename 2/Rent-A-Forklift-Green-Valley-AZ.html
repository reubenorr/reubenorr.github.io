One of the most important and widely used pieces of equipment in material handling, the lift truck is a powered industrial vehicle used to lift and transport materials for short distances.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction.

This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>

<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites. Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>Considered the most common type of forklift truck overall, counterbalanced models are designed with a weight that's built into the rear of the truck's body.

The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>

If you've bought it from a store, it was probably lifted from its place on the shelf by a worker many feet in the air with an order picker forklift.</p>
