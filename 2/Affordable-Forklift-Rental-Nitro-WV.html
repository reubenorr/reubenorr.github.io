<p>Corporate rates are offered by some larger rental companies. Since they can work on all kinds of job sites, rough terrain forklifts are some of the most versatile small machines. Many models are equipped with stabilizers to ensure safe movement with shifting loads from one side of the machine to the other. When not in use, pallet jacks should be rolled into an area that does not have pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself.
