<p>LP engines, propane, diesel forklifts and more. Choosing the right forklift is important for your business. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard.

Order pickers have a different steering control and they can turn sharper than a usual forklift.</p>
<p>Always drive unloaded trucks with the forks downgrade. Have brakes set and wheel blocks in place to prevent movement of trucks, trailers, or railroad cars while loading or unloading.
