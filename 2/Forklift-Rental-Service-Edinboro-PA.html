<p>Our range of products include Order Picker Forklift and Forklift Truck. Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again. When you're looking to buy a forklift in Bristol, the first thing you should do is pick up the phone to us. It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>
<p>Lift Capacity: 12000 lbs. The Raymond 5000 Series order pickers deliver exceptional versatility, intuitive handling and easy maintenance.

Forklift training has many names, such as forklift licensing or forklift certification.</p>

<p>While the machine is designed to work on rough terrain, it isn't always set to work on all types of terrain.

Many lifted truck owners purchased standard vehicles and later make modifications to them, either by themselves or with the help of a mechanic.</p>

Please note there will be an additional LO Licence processing fee payable to WorkSafe upon successful completion of your forklift training course.</p>
