<h3>4 Fork Forklift Westwood MA</h3>

Our Lift Trucks offers a complete range of durable lift trucks designed to handle your material handling applications.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Rugged construction and excellent pricing make this pallet truck the best value for your material handling needs. WIU Physical Plant will document operator training and an evaluation of the operator's performance while using the forklift.
