<h3>Counterbalance Forklift Mckinney TX</h3>
<p>Right now, drivers absolutely love vehicles capable of off-road driving. Their decision to go with a Liftking product was in part due to the versatility of Liftking's robust rough-terrain forklift,” says Mark Aldrovandi, sales manager at Liftking. The most important things to know when you choose a forklift are its size, lift and load capacity, and configuration.</p>
<p>Choosing the right forklift for your business can be challenging and time consuming. How forklifts operate differently from a car. Their lift trucks start at 2,500 lbs weight lifts and go upwards of 125,000. For over 50 years, Liftking has grown to be the home of a complete line of Rough Terrain forklifts for both commercial and military clients. Stockpickers are used at elevations higher than the second level of racking in a warehouse or distribution center.</p>
