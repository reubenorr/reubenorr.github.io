Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking.

Unlike other industrial trucks, they don't have a mast and use pallet forks or a platform to haul loads several inches off of the ground. From sit-down to stand-up electric counterbalanced forklifts, you can find the right model to suit your business.</p>

Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
