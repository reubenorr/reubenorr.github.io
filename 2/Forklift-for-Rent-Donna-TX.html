When working in or walking through areas where powered industrial trucks are being used, especially forklifts, be mindful of traffic patterns and do not cross immediately in front of a moving forklift.</p>
<p>In addition, while reach trucks can be used at heights up to 40ft, this position places physical strain upon the operator's neck and eyes and so it not a recommended height for frequent use.

<p>Picking out the right lift kit height means you'll need to know a little bit more about how certain lift heights will affect your vehicle's performance and what they are generally used for.
