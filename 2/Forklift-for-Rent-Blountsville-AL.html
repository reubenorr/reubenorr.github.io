The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>Enhanced off-road performance When you lift your truck you're getting more ground clearance which allows you to tackle more off-roading adventures. Moreover, the Motorised pallet truck we offer is quality approved and sturdy. They excel at having the best matched rental equipment for your application. These features ensure that the machines can move safely on loose ground, rocky areas, and uneven terrain.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1, of at full rearward till permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, whichever is less stable, Where tilt restrictions for various elevations are employed, and the rearward tilt position is determined to be less stable, the truck should be tested at maximum elevation for each tilt restriction permitted by the truck mechanism.</p>
