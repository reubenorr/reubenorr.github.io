Damage to both the forklift and load can be increased when the reach is extended while the truck is moving. We are one leading and largest supplier of Hydraulic Pallet Truck in North India. The most important part of parking lot safety for any vehicle, lifted or not, is being aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>There are even lifted truck interest groups and clubs, which are excellent sources of information about the best local deals on these vehicles. Industrial Counterbalanced Forklift trucks have been used since the 1960's to aid in the transportations of heavy warehousing materials over short distances and heights.

Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>

A hydraulic hand pump is powered by manual movement and meant for projects requiring portability.
