<p>Widely demanded by various industries like textile, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and warehouse, we provideÂ ForkliftsÂ onÂ RentalÂ basis. Look no further than Industrial Lift Truck.

<p>Many warehouses and similar operations only need specific equipment at certain times of the year. Our nationwide dealer network has a broad range of lift truck models available for immediate rental. Fewer Responsibilities: With the purchase of a service or maintenance plan, if anything does go wrong with the leased forklift, the dealer will take care of it.</p>

<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>

<p>3-wheel forklifts are typically more maneuverable than 4-wheel machines. Your crew can easily drive these machines through small openings and use them in tight workspaces. As a result, customers can get the best possible lift kit installation process. The Cat Lift Trucks Scholarship Program has awarded more than $130,000 in educational assistance to Houston-area students.</p>
<p>Lift kits can put added pressure on the driveshaft angles , causing intense vibrations at peak speeds. If you require an order picking forklift that can utilised for high racking situations, we have a range that can complete these tasks with ease. Moreover, an optical sensor mounted on the load section can automatically lower pallets to an ideal working height.</p>

<p>I found the right forklift on Damoli's website and just ordered it over the phone. So this is not the same type of lift as a body lift kit.
