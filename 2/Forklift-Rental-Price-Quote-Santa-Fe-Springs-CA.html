There is a big difference between rough terrain forklifts and conventional forklifts. Forklifts are named after their fork-like prongs that lift up the load. If the employee was hired: The initial training and evaluation of that employee must be completed: Before December 1, 1999 By December 1, 1999 After December 1, 1999 Before the employee is assigned to operate a powered industrial truck.</p>

Larger Tires: You're able to attach larger tires to a lifted truck to get more traction off road or in snow.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 per cent slope for loaded truck (Test #N5), and a 14 percent or 18 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N5A), depending on whether the truck has single rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual rear-wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup.
