<p>DaSilva says Stackers comparable to forklifts cost a little over $6,000, or half the price. We provide heavy-duty forklifts for moving your cargo. A rough terrain forklift is set up to deal with a number of weights and loads, but the operator is the key source who focuses on keeping everyone safe and the machine safe. Purchasing a new rough terrain lift truck can cost up to $100,000.</p>
