<h3>Purchasing Or Hiring A Safe And Efficient Forklift (Industrial Lift Truck) Coventry CT 06238</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>The 12,000 lb. electric is built on a larger frame than the 8,000 to 10,000 lb. trucks. Though pallet jacks are indeed very handy equipment to have around the warehouse, it's important to ensure that workers know how to operate them safely. The higher ground clearance will help your truck handle different types of road conditions. The Rental Department of Pengate Handling Systems strives to provide quality equipment and solutions for your short and long-term rental needs.</p>
