<h2>Yale Fork Truck Alexander</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>The first thing when it comes to owning lifted trucks is to understand how you'd like to spend your money. Full Free Lift = A truck where the fork carriage travels to the top of the inner mast before the inner mast begins to rise. Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>
<p>Our Forklifts have developed a reputation of its own for being the most reliable in the market. Many trucks are supported by leaf spring suspensions.

The fall-arresting system must not interfere with the raising and lowering of the forklift platforms. Cat lift Trucks has developed two specialised order pickers to meet these needs. Guided very narrow aisle order picking truck - counterbalance type Order Picking Truck similar to the guided very narrow aisle truck, except that the operator and the controls which operate the machine are in a cage welded to the mast.</p>
