<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The forklift's overhead guard will quickly pin or crush a jumping operator. There are two different ways that lift kits are designed, which dictates how they are installed and each one lifts the truck in a different way.

Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits. Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean that everyone should jump feet first into the decision to install a lift kit on their truck. All rough terrain forklifts have heavy-duty tires that allow them to tackle outdoor conditions. May have more ground clearance than a cushion tire forklift.
