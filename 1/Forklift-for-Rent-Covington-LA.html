A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Most RT forklifts available in the North American market use Tier 4-Final engines, and many of these engines are rated at 74 horsepower, such as the 4.4-liter JCB EcoMax engine used in the company's model 950 RT forklift. A person performing this work is required to hold an order picking forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence.

Guided Very Narrow Aisle truck - A counterbalance type Sit Down Rider Electric Forklift fitted with a specialized mast assembly.</p>
<p>The walk-behind pallet stacker is basically a forklift with a mast, operating on battery power. Many forklifts have an automatic alarm that will sound when you travel in reverse.
