<h3>Why Manual Pallet Jack Safety Is Important Brewton AL 36426</h3>
<p>Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond Certified Technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility. Of course, every lift truck will need maintenance and repairs, so renting under a full-service maintenance program can eliminate the risk of unexpected budget-busting repair bills.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
