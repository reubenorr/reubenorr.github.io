A electric hand pallet truck is one of the most commonly used lift trucks in industrial companies. Should you operate forklift trucks you will be aware that all drivers need to be properly trained and certified. We're here to answer your questions and to finally put to rest which is better, a lifted truck or a lowered truck. Yet, another place where pallet trucks can be useful that is often overlooked is in a retail work environment.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
