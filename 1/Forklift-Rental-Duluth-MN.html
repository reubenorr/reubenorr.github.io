<p>Class VII - Rough terrain forklift is a generic term used to describe forklifts typically intended for use on unimproved natural terrain and disturbed terrain construction sites.

The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 per cent slope for loaded truck (Test #N5), and a 14 percent or 18 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N5A), depending on whether the truck has single rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual rear-wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>The latter allows forklift designers more freedom in ergonomic design. The good news is you don't need to have any experience of driving a forklift truck to start learning with an accredited training provider. Our entire range of electric order pickers is characterised by extremely robust construction.
