This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space. With FLC's counterbalance forklift certification, you're covered in case of an accident. You can choose between a body lift kit, a suspension lift kit, and leveling lift kits. This is a testament to the impact that lift truck manufacturers and dealers have on the U.S. economy, says Johnson, and also the critical nature of operator training and safety in the context of the workplace.</p>
<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>
