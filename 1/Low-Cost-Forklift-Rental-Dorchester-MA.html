<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>

The lift helps going through or over tough terrain and is especially great for off-roading and mudding enthusiasts.</p>

Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need.
