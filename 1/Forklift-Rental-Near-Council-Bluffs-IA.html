<p>Many rough terrain forklifts come with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive options.

Use: Most commonly used forklift in the U.S. Primarily used indoors in warehouse type operations, good for use on smooth surfaces only. Overall Height Raised = The maximum extended height of the top of the load backrest or fork carriage of a completely extended mast.</p>
<p>The upgraded dual exhaust on this lifted truck roars, sure to turn heads whether you're off-road or in Dayton. Pallet trucks are the efficient and simple mode of transporting palletized loads on the shop floor. Suspension lifts can enable steeper approach, departure, and breakover angles, higher ground clearance, and helps accommodate larger wheels and tires.</p>

<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.)
