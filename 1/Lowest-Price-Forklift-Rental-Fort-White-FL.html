Our innovations include the unique BT Pro Lifter, which easily moves a heavy load, reducing manual effort by up to 67%. Many people choose to hire their forklifts, but there are a multitude of benefits associated with buying forklifts outright.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>

<p>The larger models use a telescoping boom with lift capacities up to 10,000 pounds (4,540 kg), vertical reaches up to 40 feet (12 m) and forward reaches of 25 feet (7 m) or more. Lencrow Forklifts has a range of new electric-powered order pickers to suit each operator style and handling application. The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination.</p>

<p>For trucks with tilting forks, the forks should be horizontal of at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. The boom can reach out directly in front of the forklift, and it can be extended to raise directly above it. Variable reach rough terrain forklifts were originally built for residential and commercial masonry trades. If you need to service, buy or rent a lift truck, make Altorfer Lift Truck your first call.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
