<p>Also for rent, sit-down, stand-on or walk-behind forklifts. Pallet Trucks, as considered under the scope of the report, are used in warehouses for effective storage and supply of consumer goods. With a solid schedule of consistent and high-quality maintenance, your forklift can be relied upon to provide years of worry-free performance. Regardless of the order picker or forklift job, one thing is for certain: if your employees drive order picker trucks, they need an order picker license.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust.
