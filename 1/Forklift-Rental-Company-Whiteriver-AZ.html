<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence. Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls.
