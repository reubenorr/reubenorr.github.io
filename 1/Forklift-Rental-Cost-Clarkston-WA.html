The dual path is perfect for that driver who carries more weight on one side of their truck than the other. Rough terrain forklifts have increased traction on the tyres for navigation over poor terrain. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>

If your company utilizes a very narrow aisle operation this classification of lift trucks is for you.</p>
<p>Some reach trucks come with a tilt mechanism in the cab to help the driver gain a better view of the operation. FORKS: Horizontal tine-line projections, normally suspended from the carriage, for engaging and supporting loads. Designed for terrain that pneumatic tire forklifts can't handle.

<p>Many countries and regions require fork lift operator training and, in some cases, a fork lift operator license, due to the potentially dangerous nature of the work and the high value of merchandise handled by lifts. Push the handle down to pump up the pallet jack, then let the handle come back using the mechanical spring.

<p>The 12,000 lb. electric is built on a larger frame than the 8,000 to 10,000 lb. trucks.
