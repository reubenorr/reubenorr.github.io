<h2>Forklift Rules Of The Road Hull </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects.

<h3>Forklift Operator Course Hull MA</h3>
<p>When placed on the forks, the center of mass of the test weight should be located on the longitudinal centerline of the truck.
