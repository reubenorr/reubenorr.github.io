<p>While you could still take a road trip or head to any holiday destination you want, most lifted Jeep owners will want to do something that takes advantage of their vehicle's abilities. For more information about our rentals, please email or contact us today at 1 (800) 283-4177. Skilled forklift operators annually compete in obstacle and timed challenges at regional forklift rodeos.</p>
<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>

<p>With nine models to suit specific heavy duty applications, the H25-32XM series of all terrain forklifts provides high productivity, reliability, fuel efficiency and outstanding driver comfort to deliver an excellent return on investment.
