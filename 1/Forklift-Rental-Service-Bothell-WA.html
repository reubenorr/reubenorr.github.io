<p>They offer numerous models that can suit any materials handling job. Order pickers work best in warehouses that operate for library archival storage, retail applications and furniture picking. Different forklifts are made for different loading capacity and height of pallet racks.

A walkie stacker forklift is designed for the operator to walk behind the truck and steer it through an attached handle.</p>
