<p>We provide high quality counterbalance forklift, reach forklift truck, pallet truck, stacker dedicated to your business. The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>
<p>With that much juice, the 2C5000 can lift a full payload at 125 ft per minute while an empty payload reaches 130 fpm. The best thing about rough terrain forklifts is that they allow you to work in places traditional forklifts can't go. Rugged terrain that is difficult to excavate, access or navigate doesn't need to slow your work down. Check out our range of used forklifts available for purchase.</p>
<h2>Warehouse Forklift Trucks Raymond </h2>

No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job. Models through 16,000 pounds lift capacity use a standard 100-horsepower engine; the next two larger models use a 142-horsepower engine; and the largest model, the LK30P44, has a 225-horsepower engine.</p>
<p>Our range of Super Short Hand Pallet Truck is scientifically designed to achieve maximum production capacity with minimum human efforts. These types of forklifts are faster and much more powerful than electric forklifts, but are also much louder.

When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials.
