Also, a selection of masts offered by some RT forklift manufacturers allow buyers to tailor machines more closely to applications frequently encountered.

<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop.
