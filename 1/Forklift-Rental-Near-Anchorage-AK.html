Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>

Load capacity of up to 1.2 ton and picking heights up to 12.1 metres, our high-level order pickers set new performance standards. 2013 Case 586H, 6000 Lb Capacity Rough Terrain Forklift, Diesel Engine, 22′ Three Stage Mast, Side Shift, Runs Great with only 3679 hours, call Mike today at (260) 616-0651 or email me at mike@ for more information.</p>

FORK LIFT TRUCK: A high lift self-loading truck, equipped with load carriage and forks for transporting and tiering loads. Industry-leading run times - 16 hours on one battery charge in most applications - allow these high-level order picker forklifts to work longer without stopping to recharge for greater efficiency.</p>
<h2>Nissan Lift Trucks Anchorage</h2>
<p>The size of these machines allows them to lift greater capacities than the smaller forklifts featured in this list. Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
<p>3-wheel forklifts are typically more maneuverable than 4-wheel machines. Your crew can easily drive these machines through small openings and use them in tight workspaces. As a result, customers can get the best possible lift kit installation process. The Cat Lift Trucks Scholarship Program has awarded more than $130,000 in educational assistance to Houston-area students.</p>
<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>

Safety standards implemented thoroughly can help keep workplace accidents at a minimum.</p>
<p>Beyond the size and power source, when choosing a forklift you need to evaluate a variety of factors that impact your long-term cost, including how much and how high the machine can lift, how careful you need to be when manipulating the load in sensitive areas and whether you should buy or rent a forklift.
