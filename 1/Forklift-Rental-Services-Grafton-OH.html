<p>If you want as much ground clearance as possible and a bold lifted look, equipping your truck with both a suspension lift kit and a body lift kit is a great option. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>
<p>A pallet truck, also called a pallet jack, is a device that can greatly facilitate moving and lifting goods within the working environment.

The maximum height with respect to the maximum weight - If a forklift can lift a maximum weight of 2.5 tons and has a lift height of up to five metres, it might not be able to lift 2.5 tons up five metres.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>We are involved in manufacturing and supplying a wide range of Hand Pallet Truck. Other operator comforts include the tilting and telescoping steering column, standard adjustable suspension seat, USB ports, and the standard reverse travel handle and horn button, which add to the comfort and safety of reversing with a load, allowing the operator to keep hands inside the forklift.</p>
