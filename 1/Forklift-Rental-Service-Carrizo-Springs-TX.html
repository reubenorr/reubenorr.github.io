Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site.

<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop. They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>

<p>High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet.

In addition to standard models, TVH also offers specific models such as the silent pallet truck, scissor pallet trucks, weighing pallet trucks and pallet trucks for quarter pallets and fish totes.</p>
<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful.
