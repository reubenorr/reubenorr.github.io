<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>This can occur if the forklift has loads that are over its designed capacity. Keep in mind that the higher you are lifting a load the lower the capacity will become. Self-driving forklifts, blockchain technology, ergonomic designs, virtual reality and lithium-ion batteries are all components of today's material handling equipment. In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>

This is expected to drive the demand for warehousing, which in turn, will drive the global Pallet Trucks market in the coming years.</p>

Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
